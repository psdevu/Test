We get stuck in feelings of sadness or anxiety. Sometimes we feel trapped by our own rage, towards ourself and towards others, or stuck in loneliness. We want to change but feel that we can't. There is no more powerful tool for healing our mind than meditation. But we need to make sure we are doing it correctly. And that means we need to harness the power of intention.\n\nIn this evening talk and guided meditation, Buddhist monk, Gen Kelsang Menla, will teach us a meditation that focuses on the use of intention. By skillfully channeling that wish to change we tap into the immense creative power of our mind, and connect to our naturally good heart. Training in this way enables us to make friends with our own mind and to become the person we truly wish to be.\n\nThis meditation can be used by anyone, of any spiritual (or non-spiritual) background. Gen Kelsang Menla will guide us in the process, sharing with us his own journey of inspiration by Buddha's wisdom.","guideName":"events","listingTags":"","address1":"119 North 11th Street","address2":"","city":"Williamsburg","state":"NY","zip":11249,"startsAt":"12/9/2019 19:00:00","endsAt":"12/9/2019 20:30:00","externalUrl1":"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/williamsburg-the-power-of-intention-tickets-81004106463?aff=ebdssbdestsearch","listingCategory":"","cost":"Free","venueName":"Kadampa Meditation Center - Williamsburg Branch","email":"","phone":"","country":"","longitude":"","latitude":"","locationLabel":"","brands":"","externalImageUrl":"","premiumLevel":""},{"listingName":"Wellness Workshop - Emotional, Who Me?","listingDescription":"Just One B.R.E.A.T.H. is a workshop series that focuses on mental, physical, spiritual and emotional wellness.\n\nAbout this Event\n\nEmotional, Who Me?, Presented by Chy\n\nWhether your year has been mundane, extraordinary or somewhere in between, we will celebrate each other on December 7th.\n\nThis workshop is open to women of all dance and fitness levels.

From there, you are led into either walking or seated mediation for approximately 20 – 30 minutes, as you collectively engage with mindfulness in silence with fellow participants. The session concludes with a moment of reflection, providing you with an opportunity to learn more about the individuals you have taken this journey with, and how your collective experiences relate to art. The instructor provides closure by offering a brief meditation and encouragement to the group about being mindful each day.\n\nParticipation is free and open to all. Prior meditation experience and special clothing is not required.\n\nBio\n\nHariprasad Kowtha hails from the Southwestern United States. He has been practicing Eastern spirituality all his life, and began a physical mindfulness practice by age eleven. Hariprasad teaches hatha yoga at community centers and yoga studios in West Philadelphia. He welcomes everyone to his classes, regardless of experience or ability. He bases all his practices on collective liberation, believing that mindfulness is foundational to self-determination.\n\nMindfulness\n\nMindfulness at the Museum is a series of drop-in guided meditation sessions facilitated by skilled holistic practitioners. Our exhibitions serve as the backdrop, as you learn how to become present in the “here and now.” Research shows mindfulness meditation can increase memory skills, foster compassion, and reduce stress. Each encounter is unique from the last, drawing synthesis between the mind and body, leaving participants equipped with knowledge on how to lead a balanced life.\n\nProgramming at ICA has been made possible in part by the Emily and Jerry Spiegel Fund to Support Contemporary Culture and Visual Arts and the Lise Spiegel Wilks and Jeffrey Wilks Family Foundation, and by Hilarie L. & Mitchell Morgan.","guideName":"events","listingTags":"","address1":"118 S 36th St","address2":"","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":19104,"startsAt":"12/20/2019 12:00:00","endsAt":"12/20/2019 13:00:00","externalUrl1":"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/mindfulness-at-the-museum-with-hariprasad-kowtha-tickets-69906104039?aff=ebdssbdestsearch","listingCategory":",\"Tis the season for stress and chaos… UNLESS we can stay present and manage energy!
